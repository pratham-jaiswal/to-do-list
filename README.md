# To Do List
A simple to-do list built using EJS and Express.

### Getting Started
To get started with this code, simply clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pratham-jaiswal/to-do-list.git
```

### Library Prerequisites
1. Node.js
2. Express
3. EJS
4. Nodemon (optional)
    You can install these dependencies using npm:
    ```bash
    npm init
    npm install express ejs nodemon
    ```

### Running the code
To run the code simply open your terminal/command prompt in that directory and run the following command,
```bash
node app.py
```
To avoid the need to manually stop and restart a Node.js application every time a change is made to the code, nodemon should be used. Open your terminal/command prompt in that directory and run the following command,
```bash
nodemon app.js
```
This saves time and effort, allowing you to focus on writing code and testing it, rather than worrying about restarting the application.

### Test the website
After starting the node, open a browser, type "*localhost:3000*" and hit enter.
